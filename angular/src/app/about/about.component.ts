          Even though we have more activities and information serving our days
          than ever before – work, family, friends, travel, the internet, books,
          movies – boredom is still a part of life. If you’ve found yourself
          staring blankly at a wall or failing to come up with something to fill
          your time, you’ve experienced boredom. We created a demo app to help
          you drive away boredom, a widespread feeling.

          quotes; they’re interesting ones that reveal the many different
          aspects of boredom.
